## Background

- **Expected Goals (xG)**: A statistical measure that quantifies the quality of shots taken
- Depends on factors like distance from goal, angle to goal, shot type, and player positions
- Captures the quality of scoring chances based on historical data
- Each shot gets a probability value between 0 and 1

## Limitations of xG

- **Selection bias**: xG is only recorded for shots we observe!
- Better shooters are over-represented in the data
- Significant chances without a shot event aren't recorded
- Misses opportunities where players should have shot but didn't

## Examples of xG Limitations

*Video of big chance with no shot*

*Video of multiple shots on one attack*

## Methods

- Statistical approach
- Data processing steps
  - $\theta$
- Model specifications

## Results

- Key findings
- Statistical significance
- Practical implications

## Conclusions

- Summary of main points
- Future work
- Questions and discussion
