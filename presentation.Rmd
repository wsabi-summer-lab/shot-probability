## What Are Expected Goals (xG)?

- Expected Goals (xG) is a metric that estimates the probability that a shot is scored
- Depends on factors like distance from goal, angle to goal, shot type, and player positions
- Estimated by XGBoost models trained on historical shot data
- Often used to measure the quality of a chance
- Aggregated over a match or season to measure team performance

## Limitations of xG

- Models are only trained on **observed** shots, inducing significant selection bias
- Skilled attackers who take more shots are over-represented
- Threatening attacks with no recorded shots are omitted
- Repeated shots on a single possession are added independently


## Visual Examples

*Video: Player has clear chance but passes instead of shooting*

*Video: Multiple shots from same attacking sequence*
