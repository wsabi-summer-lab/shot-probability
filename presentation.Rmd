## What are Expected Goals (xG)?

- Expected Goals (xG) estimates the probability that a shot is scored
- Estimated by an XGBoost model trained on historical shot data
- Depends on factors like distance from goal, angle to goal, shot type, and player positions
- Often used to measure the quality of a chance or a team's performance across a game

## Limitations of xG

- Selection bias: xG is only recorded for shots we observe!
- Better shooters are over-represented in the data
- Significant chances without a shot event aren't recorded
- Misses opportunities where players should have shot but didn't

## Examples of xG Limitations

*Video of big chance with no shot*

*Video of multiple shots on one attack*
